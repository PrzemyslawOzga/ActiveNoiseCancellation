## Active Noise Cancellation

In this project, the use of active noise reduction methods using feed-forward and feedback systems was demonstrated. 
The implementation of the above systems for active noise cancellation methods was carried out using the following algorithms:

- LMS - Least Mean Squares algorithm
- FxLMS - Filtered-X Least Mean Squares algorithm
- NLMS - Normalized Least Mean Squares algorithm
- FxNLMS - Filtered-X Normalized Least Mean Squares algorithm

The implementation of the above systems and algorithms was fully implemented in the MATLAB programming language, version 2022b. 
The implementation took place for the purposes of the engineering thesis.

Diagrams of the algorithms described above are shown below in a feed-forward system.
